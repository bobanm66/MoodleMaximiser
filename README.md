# MoodleMaximiser
Chrome extension to view PDFs on UoN Moodle fullscreen rather than in a tiny section of the screen surrounded by lot of chrome

##Note: Deprecated
UoN now uses a new version of Moodle incompatible with this extension which does not suffer from the problem this extension aims to solve anyway
